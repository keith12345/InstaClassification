# InstaClassification

Whether you shop from meticulously planned grocery lists or let whimsy guide your grazing, our unique food rituals define who we are. Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it easy to fill your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. After selecting products through the Instacart app, personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you.  

Instacart recently challenged the Kaggle community to predict orders over time based on previous shopping behaviour using the _“The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, Accessed from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 on 01/29=2019_ and included on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) in the [Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis) challenge.  

For this project, I've stored the data in a PostgreSQL database hosted on an AWS server. I will use Seaborn, Matplotlib, and interactive libraries to visulaize trends in the data. This should provide Instacart and others some interesting insights into online grocery shopping behaviour.
